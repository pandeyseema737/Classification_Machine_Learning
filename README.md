# Classification_Machine_Learning

This was part of IBM Data Science Course, where I practiced the classification algorithms I learned in this course. This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

I loaded a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

The end goal of the assignment was to report the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics:
