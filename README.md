# Classification_Machine_Learning

This was part of IBM Data Science Course, using the following algorithm:  K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Decision Tree Support Vector Machine Logistic Regression

In this notebook I practiced all the classification algorithms that I learned in this course.

I load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The end goal of the assignment was to report the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics:
